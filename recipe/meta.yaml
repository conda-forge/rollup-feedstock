  description: |
    Rollup is a module bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code
    into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application.
    It uses the standardized ES module format for code, instead of previous idiosyncratic
    solutions such as CommonJS and AMD. ES modules let you freely and seamlessly combine
    the most useful individual functions from your favorite libraries. Rollup can
    optimize ES modules for faster native loading in modern browsers, or output a legacy
    module format allowing ES module workflows today.
